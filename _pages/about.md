## About Me
I am **Han Hu** (胡晗), a Research Scientist at **Huawei Hong Kong Research Center**.  
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from **Monash University, Australia**, in December 2024.  

### Research Interests  
I am particularly interested in integrating **LLMs** and **app dynamic analysis** techniques to advance software automation, reliability, and performance.  
My research focuses on **Automated App Analysis (Dynamic)**, including **GUI Agent** and **automated app performance analysis**,  
as well as **LLM-driven Code Analysis (Static)**, covering **AI coding** and **benchmark/dataset construction**.  
(e.g. I am a **core contributor** to the following projects: [BigCodeBench](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcodebench) and [StarCoder](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2).)



### Collaboration & Opportunities

Our team, based in **Hong Kong**, is currently open to **research interns** (long-term recruitment, applications accepted year-round) and **full-time researchers** focusing on **app/on-device model performance** and **automated app analysis (AI4SE)**.  
If you are interested in collaborating on research projects or joining our team, please feel free to contact me at **hu.han@huawei.com** or **agmaiofhuhan@gmail.com**.


~~## Actively Seeking Full-time Employment~~
