## About Me
I am **Han Hu** (胡晗), a Research Scientist at **Huawei Hong Kong Research Center**.  
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from **Monash University, Australia**, in December 2024.  

My research lies at the intersection of **software engineering** and **deep learning**, with a focus on **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**.  
I am particularly interested in integrating LLMs and dynamic analysis techniques to advance software automation, reliability, and performance.

### Research Interests
My research focuses on **Automated App Analysis (Dynamic)**, including **GUI Agent** and **automated app performance analysis**,  
and **LLM-driven Code Analysis (Static)**, covering **LLM4Code**, **code understanding**, and **benchmark construction** (e.g., [StarCoder](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2), [BigCodeBench](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcodebench)).


### Collaboration & Opportunities
Our team is currently open to **research interns** (long-term recruitment) and **full-time researchers** focusing on **performance analysis** and **automated application analysis (AI4SE)**.  
If you are interested in collaborating on research projects or joining our team, please feel free to contact me at **hu.han@huawei.com**.

~~## Actively Seeking Full-time Employment~~

~~I am currently on the job market, actively pursuing opportunities as a **Research Scientist**, **Research Engineer** or **Postdoc**.~~ 
~~If there is an opening in your team that aligns with my skills, please feel free to contact me to arrange an interview.~~
