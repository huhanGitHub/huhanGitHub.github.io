## About Me

I am **Han Hu**, Chinese 胡晗, a final-year PhD student at Monash University, Australia. \
My research interests lie at the intersection of **software engineering** and **deep learning**. I am currently engaged in the following research topics:

- **Mobile Application Analysis**: This includes:
  - **Cross-device GUI Adaptation and Exploration** (phone & tablet & TV) [TOSEM'2024, NeurIPS'2023, TOSEM'2023a]
  - **Cross-platform App Analysis** (Android & iOS) [TOSEM'2023b]
  - **Analysis of Vulnerabilities in On-device Models** [TOSEM'2023b, WWW'2022, ICSE'2021]

- **AI & LLM-Assisted Software Development**: My focus in this area includes:
  - **Benchmark & Dataset Construction** for LLM related tasks [[Starcoder1 & Starcoder2](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2), under review 1]
  - **Code Generation** [under reivew 2, TOSEM'2021, ICONIP'2019]
  - **GUI Conversion** [NeurIPS'2023]


**Upon completing my PhD program, I will dedicate my research to LLM4Code,  including code generation, code summaries, and developing code LLMs.**
If you are interested in collaborating on a project or paper with me, please feel free to send me an email at agmaiofhuhan@gmail.com.


## Actively Seeking Full-time Employment

I am currently on the job market, actively pursuing opportunities as a **Research Scientist**, **Research Engineer** or **Postdoc**. 
If there is an opening in your team that aligns with my skills, please feel free to contact me to arrange an interview. 

My expertise centers around Code Generation, App Analysis, establishing LLM benchmarks and datasets, and LLM-driven product development, among other related areas.
I have a strong inclination towards industry-driven projects and roles that emphasize practical applications beyond solely contributing top-tier publications. While I am deeply involved in research, I am very confident in my coding and communication skills.
